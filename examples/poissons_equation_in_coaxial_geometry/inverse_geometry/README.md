# Inverse Laplace's equation for one-dimensional coaxial geometry with unknown distances

## Problem Setup

The partial differential equation is defined as 

$$\begin{aligned}
    \begin{cases}
        & \dfrac{\partial^2 U}{\partial r^2} + \dfrac{1}{r} \dfrac{\partial U}{\partial r} = 0 \\
        & U(r=r_0) = 1 \\
        & U(r=r_1) = 0 \\
        & r \in [r_0, r_1]
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}$$

for unknown radii $r_0$ and $r_1$ but with observations of potential $U(r)$ and known difference $\Delta r = r_1 - r_0 > 0$.
